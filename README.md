# unifiapp
Android app for crowdsourced WiFi network sharing in cities.  Was published on the Google Play store in 2015, and was running in one city with 10,000 routers in 2016-2017 via www.unifiapp.com.  The API server that accompanies the app is no longer running, but this app has been published for reference purposes and to encourage others to try out similar ideas to democratize access to Internet connectivity.

Features:
- lets you share your WiFi credentials with others, in exchange for access to thousands of other WiFi hotspots in your city
- connects to nearby WiFi hotspots that are part of the network when you come within range
- includes a VPN client for securing traffic

Android app for crowdsourced WiFi network sharing in cities.  The API server that accompanies the app is no longer running, but this app has been published for reference purposes and to encourage others to try out similar ideas.

Features:
- lets you share your WiFi credentials with others, in exchange for access to thousands of other WiFi hotspots in your city
- connects to nearby WiFi hotspots that are part of the network when you come within range
- includes a VPN client for securing traffic
